CRUD opertions> Create, read, update and delete these 4 are the most performed operations in working with DBMS

use database_name (this will create a database and will automatically switched to it)
>db.text (this query is use to create text file)
>db.text.insert({"name":"rabah"})   (this query is used to insert data in your db text file)
>show dbs	(used to show all databases)
>show collections (used to show collections/table we created)

-------------------------
******Creating and inserting only one documen/object in DB


> use mykart 
(----------this will create a database of the given name)

> db.items.insertOne({name: "Samsung", price : 200000,rating: 4.7, qty:220, sold: 200})  
(-----Inserting data, here items are are actually table but they called as collections)

******Inserting multiple documents in DB

> db.items.insertMany([{name: "Samsung", price : 200000,rating: 4.7, qty:220, sold: 200},{name: "Apple", price:300000, rating: 4.7, qty:500, sold: 450}, {name: "Realme", price:350000, rating: 4.2, qty:250, sold: 150}])  
In this function we can insert more than one object at time by passing objects in array.

*************How to search objects inserted in DataBase
>show dbs	(used to show all databases)
>show collections (used to show collections/table we created)
> db.items.find({price : 200000})

Query for items having rating greater than equal (gte) 4.0

>db.items.find({rating :{$lte:4.0}})
items having rating less than equal 4.0 

>db.items.find({rating :{$gte:4.0}})

Query for items having rating greater than equal (gte) 4.0

>db.items.find({rating :{$lt:4.0}})

Query for items having rating less than (lt) 4.0

>db.items.find({rating :{$gt:4.0}})

********AND operator
>db.items.find({rating :{$gte:4.0},price:{$gt:4.2}})

>db.items.find({rating :{$gte:4.0}},{rating:1})
(this query will sort object and will show rating only as rating:1 means rating is true)

>db.items.find({rating :{$gte:4.0}},{rating:1, qty:1})
(this query will sort object and will show rating and quantity only, as rating:1 and qty:1 means rating and qty are true)

*********OR operator
>db.items.find({$or:[ {rating :{$lt:5.0}}, {rating: {$gt:4.0}} ]})
by adding $or now my comma has become OR operator


here comma is working as AND operator 


**************Deleting items from Database
****NOTE: The deleting and find syntax are almost similar

>db.items.deleteMany({name :'Samsung'})
This Query will delete only first item in case of multiple document match

>db.items.deleteOne({name :'Samsung'})
This Query will delete multiple items of the given parameters

***************** Query for Adding collections in my database----------

>db.collections.insertOne({a:89})

>db.items.updateOne({name:"Apple"},{$set:{name:"Samsung"}})
>db.items.updateOne({name:"Apple"},{$set:{price:10000}})
This query is used to update the first matched item

>db.items.updateMany({name:"Realme"},{$set:{name:"Samsung", rating:4.7}})
Query used to update the more than one items matched
