NPM stands for Node package manager

first insatll Node from the webiste
then for verification
npm -v
node -v
now follow the below steps go to you project folder
1. npm init (this will create packages.JSON file)

2. sudo npm install -g live-server (this will install live server module globally which will create a fake server in browsers)

3. npm install lodash (this will install lodash module locally)

4. sudo npm install -g browserify (this will install browserify globally which will run modules commands in browsers)

5. browserify script.js > bundle.js (this will create a bundler file namely bundle.js once the file is create link this bundle.js file to your html file bundle.js will load modules and other JS files in itself and then will return these files on running bundle.js)

after that whenever you will make any changes in your script.js file you have to run the above command and then live-server command

6. to save your time go to packages.JSON file and look for script tag
change the "test" name let say "build" now change its function to 
"build" :"browserify script.js > bundle.js && live-server" 

now run

7. npm run build
