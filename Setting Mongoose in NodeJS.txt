simply go to your app.js
and then go to the documentation of Mongoose and copy the code and paste that code in your main function as below
before running this code you must have to make sure your main database that is mongod query is running in another terminal and on the other hand open another terminal and run mongosh query to access you collected data which you have gathered by 
dealing with the post request of the user:
**************************
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Mongoose stuff
main().catch(err => console.log(err));

async function main() {
  await mongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/contactdance');
// Defining schemas in Mongoose
  const ContactSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    phone: String,
    email: String,
    address: String,
    desc: String
  });
  const Contact = mongoose.model('Contact', ContactSchema);
  
  app.post("/contact", (req,res)=> {
    var myData = new Contact(req.body);
    myData.save().then(()=>{
      res.send("This item has been saved in Database");
    }).catch(()=>{
      res.status(400).send("Item was not saved to the data base");
    })})
************************

now open your mongosh
type following queries to see your data

>use contactdance
>show collections
>db.contact.find()
